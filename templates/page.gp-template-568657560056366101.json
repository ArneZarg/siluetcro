        "gg19WHgsgRi_text": "<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-size:18px;\">I'll be honest—<strong>when I first heard about the Elevé Reformer, I thought $2,000 was absolutely insane.</strong> At the time, I thought:&nbsp;<i>\"How can I justify this when I can barely justify 20 minutes to myself?\"</i></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-size:18px;\">I was already drowning in mom guilt, and here was this beautiful piece of equipment that cost more than our family vacation. I spent weeks agonizing over it, calculator in hand, heart racing every time I thought about hitting \"buy.\"</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-size:18px;\">But after eight months of daily use, three dress sizes down, and energy I haven't felt since before kids, I realize there were&nbsp;<strong>seven crucial things nobody told me</strong> about making the switch from studio to home. If you're battling the same guilt and doubt I was, these insights might just change everything</span></p>",
        "gg2Evxh1_j6_text": "<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-size:18px;\"><i><strong>\"Even though I hadn't been to a class in over two years, the guided routines made everything easy. I didn't have to think or worry about doing something wrong.\"</strong></i></span></p>",

I'd started and stopped so many fitness routines that I'd lost count.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-size:18px;\">I thought I'd give up like I always do. But it wasn't about discipline—it was about design.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-size:18px;\">This was different because it was designed for women like me—busy moms who need something that works WITH their chaotic life, not against it.</span></p>",
        "ggDCTNtp4Dy_text": "<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-size:18px;\"><strong>I was terrified I'd hurt myself without an instructor watching.</strong> In the studio, I used to fake confidence—nodding like I understood the cues, praying no one was watching when I messed up a transition or lost my balance.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-size:18px;\">The shame of being the \"out of shape mom\" in a room full of toned women was exhausting.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-size:18px;\">The truth?&nbsp;<strong>The Elevé's guided routines are better than most studio classes I'd taken.</strong> The video library breaks down every movement with patience I never got in crowded classes. You can pause when your toddler needs you, rewind when you miss a cue, or repeat anything until it clicks.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-size:18px;\">Within two weeks, I was doing moves I'd never attempted in studios—because I could take my time and really understand the form without judgment.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

My 4-year-old now says, \"Go do your Pilates, Mom!\" when she sees I'm stressed.

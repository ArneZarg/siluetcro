When did my shoulders start rounding forward like this? When did standing up straight become something I had to consciously think about?<\/span><br>&nbsp;<\/p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-size:21px;\"><strong>I'm 43<\/strong>, and I've spent the last three years telling myself the same story: \"This is just what happens after 40. <strong>Your metabolism slows down. Your back starts aching. You accept it and move on<\/strong>.\" But that morning, watching my 8-year-old daughter cartwheel across the living room with effortless joy, something inside me cracked open. <strong>I didn't want to accept it anymore.<\/strong><\/span><\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-size:21px;\"><strong>Maybe you know this feeling. <\/strong>The slow, creeping realization that somewhere between building a career, raising children, and taking care of everyone else, you've lost touch with the woman you used to be. The one who felt strong, graceful, confident in her own skin.<\/span><\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-size:21px;\"><strong>I tried everything to get her back. <\/strong>I joined the expensive studio down the street — you know, the one with the perfect lighting and women in matching athleisure sets. I downloaded every app, bought resistance bands that collected dust in my closet, and even invested in a Peloton that became the world's most expensive clothing rack.<\/span><\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;font-size:21px;\"><strong>Each attempt started with hope and ended with the same familiar ache of disappointment.<\/strong> Not in the programs themselves, but in my inability to stick with them.
